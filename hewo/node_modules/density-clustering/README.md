# Density Based Clustering for JavaScript

## Overview

### DBSCAN

Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is one of the most popular algorithm for clustering data.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN

### OPTICS

Ordering points to identify the clustering structure (OPTICS) is an algorithm for clustering data similar to DBSCAN.
The main difference between OPTICS and DBSCAN is that it can handle data of varying densities.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OPTICS_algorithm

**Important**

Clustering returned by OPTICS is nearly indistinguishable from a clustering created by DBSCAN.
To extract different density-based clustering as well as hierarchical structure you need to analyse **reachability plot** generated by OPTICS.

## Installation

```
npm install density-clustering
```

## Examples

### DBSCAN
```
var dataset = [
    [1,1],[0,1],[1,0],
    [10,10],[10,13],[13,13],
    [54,54],[55,55],[89,89],[57,55]
];

var clustering = require('density-clustering');
var dbscan = new clustering.DBSCAN();
var clusters = dbscan.run(dataset, 5, 2);
console.log(clusters, dbscan.noise);

/*
RESULT:
[
    [0,1,2],
    [3,4,5],
    [6,7,9],
    [8]
]

NOISE: [ 8 ]
*/
```

### OPTICS

```
// REGULAR DENSITY
var dataset = [
    [1,1],[0,1],[1,0],
    [10,10],[10,11],[11,10],
    [50,50],[51,50],[50,51],
    [100,100]
];

var clustering = require('density-clustering');
var optics = new clustering.OPTICS();
var clusters = optics.run(dataset, 2, 2);
var plot = optics.getReachabilityPlot();
console.log(clusters, plot);

/*
RESULT:
[
    [0,1,2],
    [3,4,5],
    [6,7,8],
    [9]
]
*/
```

```
// VARYING DENSITY
var dataset = [
    [0,0],[6,0],[-1,0],[0,1],[0,-1],
    [45,45],[45.1,45.2],[45.1,45.3],[45.8,45.5],[45.2,45.3],
    [50,50],[56,50],[50,52],[50,55],[50,51]
];

var clustering = require('density-clustering');
var optics = new clustering.OPTICS();
var clusters = optics.run(dataset, 6, 2);
var plot = optics.getReachabilityPlot();
console.log(clusters, plot);

/*
RESULT:
[
    [0, 2, 3, 4],
    [1],
    [5, 6, 7, 9, 8],
    [10, 14, 12, 13],
    [11]
]
